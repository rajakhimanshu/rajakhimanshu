Since class 7, I’ve been passionate about programming and problem-solving, which led me to explore backend development, AI, and machine learning. Over the years, I’ve gained hands-on experience in building scalable systems with Python, MQL5, and C#.

Alongside my programming journey, I actively trade in the financial markets, where I combine my technical skills with market knowledge to design and develop automated trading systems at an institutional standard.

Currently, I’m working on DisciplineOS, an AI-powered productivity assistant aimed at making personal and professional workflows smarter. My long-term goal is to create cutting-edge fintech and AI-driven solutions that bring real-world impact.
