👋 Hi, I’m Himanshu Rajak — a B.Tech Complete Science AIML Engineering student who loves building tools, automating workflows, and experimenting with AI-assisted development.

💻 I build projects fast — my most recent one is Discipline OS, an MVP I created within a week, focused on productivity and habit-building.

📊 I’m actively learning algorithmic trading, math-driven strategies, and tool development. I use and maintain small trading utilities .
Working on Things Like HFT.

🤖 These days I code with the help of AI agents (ChatGPT, Claude, Google AI) to iterate faster and ship ideas quickly.

🚀 Always exploring new tech, breaking things, fixing them, and learning along the way.
